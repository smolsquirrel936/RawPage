# Recto — Design Document Set

Upfront design for **Recto**, a Windows-first desktop PDF editor modeled on
[Right PDF Professional](https://www.rightpdf.com/zh-TW/helpcontent/Right-PDF-Pro/20933-About-this-User-Manual).
Produced with the [`design-pipeline`](./skills-specs-generation/SKILL.md) skill set, in dependency
order. *"Recto" is a working codename — see open decision O9.*

> **This file is an index only.** It owns no facts. Every statement about the product lives in
> exactly one of the documents below, and the others cross-reference it rather than restating it.

## Read in this order

| # | Document | Owns (single source of truth for…) |
|---|---|---|
| ① | **[Features.md](./Features.md)** | The complete capability catalog, and the **authoritative key-binding tables**. No stack choice, no scope cut. |
| ② | **[Tech-Stack-Plan.md](./Tech-Stack-Plan.md)** | The locked stack and license posture, the directory layout and **inward-only dependency rule**, the **mutation-through-commands** cross-cutting design, and the risk-reducing first milestone. |
| ③ | **[Architecture-FileMap.md](./Architecture-FileMap.md)** | What **every file** does and what it interacts with, plus the primary call-trace flows. |
| ④ | **[Implementation-Plan.md](./Implementation-Plan.md)** | **Stage ordering and live status**, the shared conventions, the testing strategy and Definition of Done, milestones, and traceability. |
| ⑤ | `Stage<N>-<Area>-Plan.md` — **[Stage 0's is written](./Stage0-Toolchain-Plan.md)** | *Optional per stage.* One stage's **task-level execution order** and its **stage-local design choices** — the detail that would swamp ④. Owns no product facts; ④ keeps the objectives, exit criteria, and live status. |
| ⑥ | `Stage<N>-<Area>-Testing-Guide.md` — **[Stage 0's is written](./Stage0-Toolchain-Testing-Guide.md)** | How one stage is verified: an **automated** section (exact commands and pass conditions, run by the implementer) and a **manual** section (numbered cases for what cannot run headless, walked by a person). |

**⑤ and ⑥ are forms, not a full set of existing files.** One guide per stage, written **immediately
after that stage's plan and before its first line of code** — the sequence is
**④'s stage entry → ⑤ (where a stage warrants one) → ⑥ → implement → run the guide.** Writing the
guide from the plan keeps verification independent of the implementation; written afterwards it only
confirms whatever got built, including the parts built wrong. The schedule is
[the roadmap's §5](./Implementation-Plan.md#5-per-stage-testing-guides), and both of ⑥'s sections
passing is part of that stage's Definition of Done.

**Stage 0 has both.** Every later stage has neither yet, and that absence is the correct state rather
than a gap — those files are written when their stage comes up, not in advance.

## Where to look for a given question

| Question | Document |
|---|---|
| Does the product do X? | ① |
| What does `Ctrl+K` do, and why does it mean two things? | ① §8 |
| Why PDFium and not MuPDF? | ② §3.2 |
| What am I allowed to `#include` from here? | ② §4.2, restated file-specifically in ③ §1 |
| How does a change to a document actually reach the disk? | ② §5, traced in ③ §5 flow D |
| What does this file do? | ③ §3 |
| What are we building next, and when is it done? | ④ §3–§4 |
| Which stage implements catalog section §N? | ④ §7 |
| What is still undecided? | ② §10 (risks) and ④ §8 (open decisions) |
| What are the concrete tasks for the stage we are on? | ⑤ where it exists; ④'s *Components* otherwise |
| What must I set up before work can start? | ⑤ §7 for Stage 0 — the precondition checklist |
| How do I verify stage N by hand? | ④'s *Testing → Manual* line now; ⑥ once stage N is under way |

## Current state

**Stage 0 is under way; no product code exists.** What builds today is the *scaffolding*: a pinned
toolchain, four empty layer libraries, and an empty `recto.exe`. Every ③ file row is still `○ planned`
— none of the files ③ describes has been written — and stages 1–16 are `⚪ not started`.

Stage 0's ⑤ [execution plan](./Stage0-Toolchain-Plan.md) and ⑥
[testing guide](./Stage0-Toolchain-Testing-Guide.md) were written in that order **before any code**,
which is the point of the sequence. **Tasks T1–T3 of T15 are complete** — repository skeleton,
layer target graph, and the toolchain pin with assertions TA-1…TA-9. **T4 (presets) is next.**
No guide case has been formally run, and neither the **A5** nor the **A6** verdict exists yet.

Live task-by-task status is in
[④'s Stage 0 block](./Implementation-Plan.md#stage-0--toolchain-skeleton-and-the-four-gates),
deviations included. Stage 0's whole purpose is to make the enforcement gates fail correctly *before*
there is any code for them to fail on.

## Keeping the set in lockstep

- ③ and ④ carry **live status** and must track the code. A file's ③ row is part of that file's
  definition of done; a stage's ④ status block is edited continuously, deviations included.
- **Cross-reference, never re-decide.** If the roadmap seems to need a new key binding, fix ①.
- A ④ *Components* entry must resolve to a ③ file row; a ③ flow must use ① features.
- **⑤ and ⑥ own no product facts.** A per-stage plan owns only that stage's task order and its
  stage-local choices; a testing guide owns only how that stage is verified. Both cross-reference
  ①–④ and are corrected in the same change as any design shift, like everything else here. A ⑤ that
  names a file still owes that file a ③ row.
- When a planned file is folded into another, its ③ row stays as a ⤵ breadcrumb rather than being
  deleted.
